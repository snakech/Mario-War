Details:
Firstly, this is just a small game programming practice.
This game is a remade version of the Super Mario, the game source is from the original version. This game has totally 25 levels
you can kill the monster to get the 10 marks per time. If you can get 100 points in 255 secs, you can enter the next level. 
But never ever touch the monster, otherwise you will lost 10 marks
I released the source code and map editor with this game, you can develop a funny map by yourself
